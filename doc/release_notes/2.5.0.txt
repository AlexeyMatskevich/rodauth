= New Features

* A login_return_to_requested_location_path configuration method has
  been added to the login feature.  This controls the path to redirect
  to if using login_return_to_requested_location?.  By default, this
  is the same as the fullpath of the request that required login if
  that request was a GET request, and nil if that request was not a
  GET request.  Previously, the fullpath of that request was used even
  if it was not a GET request, which caused problems as browsers use a
  GET request for redirects, and it is a bad idea to redirect to a path
  that may not handle GET requests.

* A change_login_needs_verification_notice_flash configuration method
  has been added to the verify_login_change feature, for allowing
  translations when using the feature and not using the
  change_login_notice_flash configuration method.

= Other Improvements

* new_password_label is now translatable.
