= New Features

* When using the jwt_refresh feature, you can remove the current
  refresh token when logging out by submitting the refresh token
  in the logout request, the same as when submitting the refresh
  token to obtain a new refresh token.  You can also use a value
  of "all" instead of the refresh token to remove all refresh
  tokens when logging out.

* A rodauth.otp_last_use method has been added to the otp feature,
  allowing you to determine when the otp was last used.

= Other Improvements

* When using multifactor authentication, rodauth.authenticated? and
  rodauth.require_authentication now cache values in the session and
  do not perform queries every time they are called.

* Many guides for common scenarios have been added to the
  documentation.  These augment Rodauth's existing comprehensive
  feature documentation, which is aimed to be more of a reference
  and less of a guide.

* When the verify_account_grace_period and email_auth features are
  used with a multifactor authentication feature, and the
  verify_account_set_password? configuration method is set to true,
  Rodauth no longer raises a NoMethodError when checking if the
  session was authenticated.

* In the verify_account feature, if verify_account_email_resend
  returns false indicating no email was sent, an error message
  is now used, instead of a success message.

* In the password_complexity feature, the password_dictionary
  configuration method was previously ignored if the default
  password dictionary file existed.

* Rodauth and all features that ship with it now have 100% branch
  coverage.
