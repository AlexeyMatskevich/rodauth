= New Features

* A check_csrf configuration method has been added for checking
  the CSRF token.  This is useful in cases where the CSRF protection
  is provided by something other than the Roda route_csrf plugin.

= Other Improvements

* When using the http_basic_auth feature, logged_in? now checks for
  Basic authentication if the session is not already authenticated
  and Basic authentication has not yet been checked.  This increases
  compatibility for applications that were using the http_basic_auth
  feature in Rodauth 1.

* When creating accounts, the password field now correctly uses the
  new-password autocomplete attribute instead of the current-password
  autocomplete attribute.

* When using the jwt feature, Rodauth no longer checks CSRF tokens
  in requests to Rodauth routes if the request submitted is a JSON
  request, includes a JWT, or Rodauth has been configured in JSON-only
  mode.

* When using the verify_account_grace_period feature, if there is an
  unverified account without a password, do not consider the account
  open.  Attempting to login into the account in such a case now
  shows a message letting the user know to verify the account.

* The json_response_body configuration method is now used consistently
  in the jwt feature for all JSON responses.  Previously, there were
  some cases that did not use it.
