= Skip login page if already authenticated

In some cases it may be useful to skip login/registration pages when the user
is already logged in. This can be achieved as follows.  Note that this only
matters if the user manually navigates to the login or create account pages.

  plugin :rodauth do
    # Redirect logged in users to the wherever login redirects to
    already_logged_in { redirect login_redirect }
  end
